Q1
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1 
Git creates an empty repository on Branch Master and creates an "Initial commit," however this apparently does not count as a commit!! You then add files. There are still zero commits.

Q2
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2
The staging area is a subset of files from the working directory that are functionally part of a build. I assume this includeds relevant doccumentation files. These files are gathered or "added" to the staging ared before they are "locked in" as a commit.
