Q1
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1 
Git creates an empty repository on Branch Master and creates an "Initial commit," however this apparently does not count as a commit!! You then add files. There are still zero commits.

Q2
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2
The staging area is a subset of files from the working directory that are functionally part of a build. I assume this includeds relevant doccumentation files. These files are gathered or "added" to the staging ared before they are "locked in" as a commit. 

R3
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You may also want to commit your changes to the file. When you're ready to move on, click "Next" and Sarah will go over a concept called branching.git status

R4
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

You may also want to commit your changes to the file. When you're ready to move on, click "Next" to hear a perspective from an experienced Git user.
